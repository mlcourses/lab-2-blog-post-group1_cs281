# Lab 2: Digital Design!


## Overview and Motivation
This lab aims to expand on the previous lab and by introducing the design of two important circuits. In this lab we will be tasked with designing and creating a multiplexer and also design an adder circuit.


1. Build a 2 to 1 mux out of AND, OR and NOT gates. Test with switches.
2. Build a 4 to 1 mux using a 74150 mux chip. Test with switches.
3. Build a 4 to 1 mux using a 74150 mux chip. Test with Arduino program.
4. Design and build a 1 bit adder circuit.
